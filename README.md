# Convex Optimization
## StanfordOnline: SOE-YCVX0001

Syllabus

1. Introduction
2. Convex sets
3. Convex functions
4. Convex optimization problems
5. Duality
6. Approximation and fitting
7. Statistical estimation
8. Geometric problems
9. Unconstrained minimization
10. Equality constrained minimization
11. Interior point methods

Course takeaways:
- Lecture 9. Review of algebra and how to optimise basic linear algebra. Good cultural background of BLAS and LAPACK. I need to check ATLAS to optimise blocking.
- Understanding of dual problem and significance of the many ouput parameters thrown by modern optimisation packages.
- Definitely now I can recognise convex problems or alternatively transform problems into convex form.
- Beautiful interpretation of SVM and other classification methods in lecutre 8.
- The course is useful for from small to mid-sized problem. Large scale problems might need the material covered in ee364b.


This is a more comprehensive course, covering more and to some extent clearer than Stanford's book:
