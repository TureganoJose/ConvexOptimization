## StanfordOnline: SOE-YCVX0001

Syllabus

1. Introduction
2. Convex sets
3. Convex functions
4. Convex optimization problems
5. Duality
6. Approximation and fitting
7. Statistical estimation
8. Geometric problems
9. Unconstrained minimization

Course takeaways:
- Lecture 9. Review of algebra and how to optimise basic linear algebra. Good cultural background of BLAS and LAPACK. I need to check ATLAS to optimise blocking.
- Understanding of dual problem and significance of the many ouput parameters thrown by modern optimisation packages.
- Beautiful interpretation of SVM and other classification methods in lecutre 8.
